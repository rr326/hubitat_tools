# Development Page

## TODO
* P1


* Bundle size
    * My app seems way bigger than it shoudl be. 1.3mb of vendor code? Why>?
    * See vue-cli build --report
    * Is it moment? request? or does it just require some manual cleanup? 
    * Not worth fixing now.
    * Uncomment code in vue.config.js

* Lots of this is way too convoluted and confusing. Needs refactoring
    * Setting IPs
    * Navigation guards
